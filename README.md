# What is this project about

Learning how to build a REST API with SpringBoot & PostgreSQL.
- Use a URL to get information from the database

# What do we need to get started?
## Pre-requisites 
- Basic knowledge of PostgreSQL
- Basic knowledge of Java (SpringBoot)

## Installations
> Note: In this guide, we will be using Eclipse IDE, PostgreSQL, Postman.

# How did we do it?
## 1. Database Setup
Creation of database will not be covered here. Assumes that you have already set up a PostgreSQL table in your local machine. Get ready the username and password of the database used.

## 2. SpringBoot Project Generation
Let's generate a SpringBoot project with https://start.spring.io/. It is important to include the following dependencies:
- Spring Web
- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Driver

> Note: You can find the installed dependencies in POM.xml.

## 3. SpringBoot Packages
Open up the project in Eclipse. You will need to create the following packages:
- Model
- Service
- Controller

### Model Package
Notice how @Table & @Column attribute name matches the database columnsâ€™ names. Basically, the JPA maps between Java objects and database tables defined via persistence metadata.
```
import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

@Entity
@Table(name="pkmn")
public class Pkmn {
	
	@Id
	@Column(name="id")
	private int id;
  
  ...
}
```

### Service Package
By extending JpaRepository we get a bunch of boilerplate CRUD methods e.g., findAll(), findByName().  We can also include additional functionality to the functions by implementing the interface class.
```
public interface PkmnRepository extends JpaRepository<Pkmn, Integer> {
  
  Pkmn findById(int id);
	List<Pkmn> findAll();
}
```

### Controller Package
Most importantly, by using the annotation @RestController, it refers that the class takes care of all mapping request data to the defined request handler method. @RequestMapping is a request handler that specifies a path and what to do when the path is called.
```
@RestController
public class ApiController {
	
	@RequestMapping("/findall")
	public List<Pkmn> findAll() { ... }
}
```

## 4. Connect SpringBoot Application to Database
Before running the application, you have to declare your database credentials in order to connect to your application to the database. Declare in application.properties.

## 5. PostMan Verification
Finally, build and run the application. While running, open Postman and create a new REST request
